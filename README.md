## Description
The Pine's Blade is an inifinite auto runner game. You play as a pine marten who must get rid of the 
lumberjacks trying to destroy the forest while leaving nature untouched. The up arrow key makes the player jump,
in order to avoid bushes. The down arrow key makes the player slide, in order to avoid spider webs. Lastly, the 
right arrow key makes the player slash, and this is the only way to avoid lumberjacks. 

In front of the player is a bar that communicates your slash range, once this overlaps a lumberjack it means 
your slash will succesfully destroy them. It is important to time every action correctly, because each one has 
a cooldown you cannot escape from. The majority of the files in my repository are image files that are required for the animation 
and art the game uses. The objects.py folder contains the obstacle classes in order to keep my code less cluttered, 
and the project.py contains the actual game. Out of everything in the game I would say the way it looks is what I am most proud of,
and I took a lot of time drawing each of the animations by hand.

I believe the first thing that could be improved is also the animations, because in some actions like the slide or slash, I 
simply didn't have enough time to draw the rest of the frames. I also think how my code was organized could be improved as 
well. In the beginning everything was pretty clean, but towards the end I found myself putting more of the code into main
instead of having its own class or method. While I think its playable, I would have also liked to have implemented a few 
more mechanics, such as a score counter or gradually increasing the enemy spawn rate. Overall I am quite happy with 
how it turned out
